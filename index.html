      I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at

        advised by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/">Zhicong Lu</a>.
      I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan">Sichuan, China</a>, spent four years in Hong Kong, and now live in Syracuse, USA. <br />
