    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi there! <br />
      My name is Yigang Qin. <br />
      Pronounce it as /i:gun tfing/ <br />
      I am a computer science student. <br />
      I am interested in critical human-computer interaction (HCI), 
      information infrastructure, and science and technology studies (STS). <br />
      I was born in China, but now I am living in Hong Kong. <br />
      This page lists some of my work. <br />
      I enjoy reading, movies, and traveling.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research interest is studying how new information technologies 
      impact our work, production, and social divisions. 
      I aspire to incorperate both virtual and material approaches 
      in my research to understand information infrastructures, data, and algorithms.
