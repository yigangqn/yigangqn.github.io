    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      This's <em>Yigang Qin</em> [ɪgʌn tʃɪn], an incoming Ph.D. student in Information Science and Technology at 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>.
      I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science at 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">City University of Hong Kong</a> 
        where I have been advised by 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/">Dr. Lu, Zhicong</a>.
      I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan">Sichuan, China</a>, and now live in Hong Kong. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My overall research interests span from critical human-computer interaction/design (critical HCI/design), 
      computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), to science and technology studies (STS).
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend my leisure time on reading, movies, photography, painting, rock music, and spicy food.<br/>
      Feel free to reach out for research opportunities or simply chats!
    </p>
