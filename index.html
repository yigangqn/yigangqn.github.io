      I'm a third-year PhD student in Information Science and Technology at 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>, advised by
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eunjeongcheon.com/">EunJeong Cheon</a>.
      <!-- I pursue to understand the nature of technology and its intertwines with modernity. -->

      Over the years of doctoral study, I kept thinking about what it means for myself to be a researcher. Is it for seeking the eternity of knowledge, intellectual freedom? Is it aiming to change something? Or is it simply a way of surviving. 
      The path that gradualy unfolds in front of me is somewhat selfish, for which seeks to answer the questions that trouble <em>me</em> the most, about how the whole of modernity with its technologies determines the existence of human beings.
      I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan">Sichuan, China</a>, spent four years in Hong Kong, and now live in Syracuse, USA.

      My research falls broadly in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Science and Technology Studies (STS).
      I draw on my training in sociology, anthropology, geography, and informatics to 
      ask questions about <b>labor process, gender relation, and political economy of information technologies</b>
      in global contexts.
