    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      My name's <em>Yigang Qin</em> [ɪgʌn tʃɪn].
      I'm an incoming PhD student at the iSchool of 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">
        Syracuse University
      </a>. <br />
      Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science at the 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">
        City University of Hong Kong
      </a> where I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/">Dr. Zhicong Lu</a>.
      I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan">Sichuan, China</a>, and now live in Hong Kong. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My overall research interests span from critical human-computer interaction/design (critical HCI/design), 
      computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), to science and technology studies (STS).
    </p>
    <p>
      In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, movies, photography, painting, rock music, and spicy food.
      <br/>I also host a <a target="_blank" href="https://qin.zone">blog website</a> talking about films and lifes, 
      but it's in Chinese :)
