    <p>
      I'm a third-year PhD student in Information Science and Technology at 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>, working with
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eunjeongcheon.com/">Dr. EunJeong Cheon</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research areas are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Science and Technology Studies (STS).
      I draw on insights from sociology, anthropology, geography, and informatics to 
      ask questions about the political economy of digital technologies in the global contexts.
      I study the process of producing as well as consuming technical systems, focusing on three mechanisms:
      <ul>
        <li> (1) how technologies function in capitalist labor process of production; </li>
        <li> (2) how technologies are produced and constructed as values for societal good; </li>
        <li> (3) how technical development relies on inequality among genders and nationalities.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The way I approach to these questions are interpretive and critical in general — sometimes 
      phenomenological, sometimes comparative or genealogical. They structure how specifically
      I conduct my interview, ethnography, and archival research.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My work received several awards in leading HCI conferences, including Honorable Mention Award in 
      Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2025), 
      and Recognition for Contribution to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in 
      Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW 2024). I also present at Society for Social Studies of Science (4S).
