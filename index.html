    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      This's <em>Yigang Qin</em> [ɪgʌn tʃɪn], a PhD student at the School of Information Studies at 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>, advised by
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eunjeongcheon.com/">Dr. EunJeong Cheon</a>.
      I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science at 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">City University of Hong Kong</a>, 
        where I was advised by 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/">Dr. Zhicong Lu</a>.
      I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan">Sichuan, China</a>, spent four years in Hong Kong, and now live in Syracuse, USA. <br />
    </p>

    <p>My research falls in the fields of Human-computer interaction (HCI), 
      social computing, and Science and technology studies (STS).
      I use interviews, ethnography, content analysis, and computational methods to study information infrastructures from a sociotechnical lens 
      with input from HCI, STS, and sociology. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I enjoy novels, movies, photography, painting, rock music, and spicy food.<br/>
      Feel free to reach out for research opportunities or simply chats!
    </p>
