    <h2>Dear visitor,</h2>
    <p>
      Hello there! <br /><br />
      My name's <em>Yigang Qin</em> [ɪgʌn tʃɪn]. <br />
      I'm an undergraduate computer science student at the 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">
        City University of Hong Kong
      </a>. <br />
      Luckily advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/">Dr. Zhicong Lu</a>. <br />
      Also getting a minor in Modern and Contemporary Chinese Literature. <br />
      I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan">Sichuan, China</a>, and now live in Hong Kong. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My research interests broadly cover <b>human-computer interaction (HCI), social computing, 
      critical computing, and infrastructure studies</b>.
      I'm particularly interested in studying how computational technologies 
      impact the myriad aspects of our life and work, and the way they produce and 
      reproduce <b>inequality and power</b>. 
      I examine both virtual and material realms of computing, including
      infrastructures, data, and algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, movies, painting, rock music, traveling, 
      and spicy food. Say hi!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours sincerely, <br />
      Yigang 一刚
