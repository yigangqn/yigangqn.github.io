    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi there! <br /><br />
      My name's Yigang Qin. <br />
      Pronounce it /i:gun tfing/ <br />
      I'm a computer science student. <br />
      I was born in China, but now live in Hong Kong. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My research interests are human-computer interaction (HCI), social computing, 
      critical computing, and infrastructure studies.
      I'm particularly interested in studying how new information technologies 
      impact our work, production, and social divisions. 
      I aspire to examine both virtual and material realms of computing 
      to understand information infrastructures, data, and algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, movies, arts, and traveling.
    </p>
