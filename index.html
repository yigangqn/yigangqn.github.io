    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>
      My name's <em>Yigang Qin</em> [ɪgʌn tʃɪn]. <br />
      I'm an undergraduate computer science student at the 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">
        City University of Hong Kong
      </a>. <br />
      Luckily advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~luzhc/">Dr. Zhicong Lu</a>. <br />
      Also getting a minor in Modern and Contemporary Chinese Literature. <br />
      I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan">Sichuan, China</a>, and now live in Hong Kong. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My research interests span from human-computer interaction (HCI), social computing, 
      computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), and critical computing, to
      science and technology studies (STS) and information and communication technologies & development (ICTD). 
      <br/><br/>
      I'm particularly interested in studying how sociotechnical designs, algorithms, and interventions
      impact underrepresented (especially by gender, sexual orientation, and class) groups' life and work, 
      and how they use technologies to navigate constraints and normality. My ultimate goal is to inform inclusive, equitable,
      and just information technologies contributing to social change and human flourishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, movies, painting, rock music, traveling, 
      and spicy food. Feel free to contact me!
    </p>
