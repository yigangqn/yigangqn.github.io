    TIn this project, we intended to design a Virtual Reality (VR) application for old residential 
    communities in Hong Kong's urban areas with difficulty accessing fire-safety information. These communities 
    sorely need fire-safety education but have diverse demographic distribution, making it difficult to inform and 
    educate people via traditional means. Therefore, we wanted to explore the possibility of utilizing technologies 
    to raise fire-safety awareness in an interactive and engaging way. I collaborated with scholars from fire engineering, 
    public management, and computer science and Hong Kong community administrators to co-design this VR application. 
    It allows users to rehearse fire escape in a virtual environment and learn fire-safety knowledge by completing tasks 
    when escaping from the virtual building. I was responsible for designing, implementing, and testing the application. 
    It is now under iteration and field tests, and we expect it to be published in major app stores shortly.

    2022-2023. CS4512: Final Year Project (Independent). **<em>In Progress</em> <br />
    <span class="title">Designing an Augmented-Reality-Based Workflow for Community Awareness 
    and Agency in a Relocated Fishing Village. </span>
  </p>
  <p><b>Skills: </b><br/>
    - Community Fieldwork <br/>
    - Interaction Design <br/>
    - Usability Testing <br/>
    - User Experience Evaluation (Interview, Focus Group)
  </p>
  <p>
    Hong Kong fishing communities are relocated from their traditional habitats to inland villages to accord with 
    urban construction and marine protection. Relocated community members need to adapt to the new environment 
    that is different from their original ones because the new community plan is designed by urban designers instead of 
    the community members. The relocated fishing villagers wish to develop the community with their own needs considered. 
    However, due to their low socio-economic status, they face difficulties claiming rights and expressing their voices, 
    lowering their community awareness and agency. Following the HCI4D frameworks, this work presents the design of 
    an Augmented-Reality (AR) based community development planning workflow that encourages community affairs discussion. 
    The workflow comprises designing with papers and an AR application and showcasing the design to others, 
    through which community members discuss development issues and rethink their responsibility and agency. 
    The workflow first undergoes usability tests, then a collaborative design workshop followed by a focus group is conducted 
    to assess user experience.
