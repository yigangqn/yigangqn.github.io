    With advances in neural network-based computation, socially assistive robots (SARs) have been endowed with the ability to
    provide natural conversation to users. However, the lack of transparency
    in the computation models results in unexpected robot behaviors and
    feedback, which may cause users to lose their trust in the robot. Theory
    of mind (ToM) in cooperative tasks has been considered as a key factor in understanding the relationship between user acceptance and the
    explainability of robot behaviors. Therefore, we develop a dialog system
    using previously collected data from a robot-mediated cooperative communication task data to simulate natural language smart feedback. The
    system is designed based on the mechanism of ToM and validated with
    a simulation test. Based on the result, we believe the designed dialog
    system bears the feasibility of simulating ToM and can be used as a
    research tool for further studying the importance of simulating ToM in
    human-robot communication.

    Modern feminists leverage social media for various activities whilst the Internet incurs opposite viewpoints against them. HCI
    researchers have explored feminist practices in computer-mediated social interfaces. However, few investigated how the feminist
    perspective and its confronting ideologies are framed in discussing controversial social events. The dichotomized debate around the
    Tangshan beating incident in China is a case that epitomizes criminal frameworks as a backlash against feminism. By collecting
    related posts on Weibo and analyzing them with mixed methods, we demonstrated a gender-blind ideology, where criminal discourses
    were endorsed, but gender discourses were marginalized and stigmatized. We argue that online gender blindness, as a patriarchal
    reproduction in the digital realm, conceals gender conflicts and amplifies ideological divergence. Finally, we discuss how social media
    could respond to sustain women’s voices given the gender-blind ideology.

    Nowadays, online video websites are not only for video sharing and watching, but also work as communication
    channels of special interests such as popular science. With the interactions and participation among the
    viewers and creators, popular science videos have become an important form of science communication. In HCI
    and CSCW, previous studies about computer-mediated science communication focused on the perspectives of
    community and design opportunities in non-video forms. Little is known about the viewer’s engagements and
    the narrations of online video-based science communication. Thus, in this paper we conducted a mixed-method
    study to investigate the video uploaders, video content, and strategic narrations with viewer’s engagements
    of popular science videos shared on Bilibili, which is known for its collaborative commentary mechanism
    for videos called “Danmaku”. We first created a taxonomy of uploaders of popular science videos on Bilibili.
    Then we revealed the popular topics and coded a set of sampled videos by 9 content-related features to show
    the landscape. Finally, we illustrated the correlations between entertaining narration strategies and viewers’
    engagements via qualitative observations and the Danmaku data. This paper extends the scope of online
    video-based science communication research to Bilibili, and involves the Danmaku mechanism to the contexts.
    Our findings enrich the understanding of the viewers’ engagements with narration strategies of popular
    science communicators.
