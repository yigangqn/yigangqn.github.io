      <b>Abstract: </b>
      Robots extend beyond the tools of productivity; they also contribute to creative activities. 
      Although typically defined as utility-driven technologies designed for productive or social settings, 
      the role of robots in creative settings remains underexplored. This paper examines how robots participate in artistic creation. 
      Through semi-structured interviews with robotic artists, we analyze the impact of robots on artistic processes and outcomes. 
      We identify the critical roles of social interaction, material properties, and temporal dynamics in facilitating creativity. 
      Our findings reveal that creativity emerges from the co-constitution of artists, robots, 
      and audiences within spatial-temporal dimensions. Based on these insights, we propose several implications for 
      socially informed, material-attentive, and process-oriented approaches to creation with computing systems. 
      These approaches can inform the domains of HCI, including media and art creation, craft, digital fabrication, and tangible computing.

    <b>Abstract: </b>
    Contemporary feminists utilize social media for activism, while backlashes come along. 
    The gender-related discourses are often diminished when addressing public events regarding 
    sexism and gender inequality on social media platforms. The dichotomous debate around the 
    Tangshan beating incident in China epitomized how criminal interpretations of gender-related violence 
    became a backlash against feminist expressions. By analyzing posts on Weibo using mixed methods, 
    we describe the emerging discursive patterns around crime and gender, 
    uncovering the gender-blind sexism that refutes feminist discourses on the social platform. 
    We also highlight the critical hurdles facing grassroots feminist activism in Chinese cyberspace 
    and propose implications for the design and research related to digital feminist activism.

    <b>Abstract: </b>
    With advances in neural network-based computation, socially assistive robots have been endowed with the ability to provide 
    natural conversation to users. However, the lack of transparency in the computation models results in 
    unexpected robot behaviors and feedback, which may cause users to lose their trust in the robot. Theory of mind (ToM) 
    in cooperative tasks has been considered as a key factor in understanding the relationship between user acceptance and 
    the explainability of robot behaviors. Therefore, we develop a dialog system using previously collected data from a 
    robot-mediated cooperative communication task data to simulate natural language smart feedback. The system is designed 
    based on the mechanism of ToM and validated with a simulation test. Based on the result, we believe the designed dialog 
    system bears the feasibility of simulating ToM and can be used as a research tool for further studying the importance of 
    simulating ToM in human-robot communication.
