  <p>
    With advances in neural network-based computation, socially assistive robots have been endowed with the ability to provide 
    natural conversation to users. However, the lack of transparency in the computation models results in 
    unexpected robot behaviors and feedback, which may cause users to lose their trust in the robot. Theory of mind (ToM) 
    in cooperative tasks has been considered as a key factor in understanding the relationship between user acceptance and 
    the explainability of robot behaviors. Therefore, we develop a dialog system using previously collected data from a 
    robot-mediated cooperative communication task data to simulate natural language smart feedback. The system is designed 
    based on the mechanism of ToM and validated with a simulation test. Based on the result, we believe the designed dialog 
    system bears the feasibility of simulating ToM and can be used as a research tool for further studying the importance of 
    simulating ToM in human-robot communication.

    Contemporary feminists utilize social media for activism, while backlashes come along.
    The gender-related discourses are often diminished when addressing public events 
    regarding sexism and gender inequality on social media platforms. 
    The dichotomized debate around the Tangshan beating incident in China epitomizes how 
    criminal interpretations of gender-related violence became a backlash against feminist expressions.
    By analyzing posts on Weibo using mixed methods, we describe the emerging discursive patterns 
    around crime and gender, uncovering the inherent gender-blind sexism that refutes 
    feminist discourses on the social platform. We also highlight the critical restrictions facing 
    grassroots feminist activism in Chinese cyberspace and propose implications for the design and 
    research related to digital feminist activism.

    Nowadays, online video websites are not only for video sharing and watching, but also work as communication
    channels of special interests such as popular science. With the interactions and participation among the
    viewers and creators, popular science videos have become an important form of science communication. In HCI
    and CSCW, previous studies about computer-mediated science communication focused on the perspectives of
    community and design opportunities in non-video forms. Little is known about the viewer’s engagements and
    the narrations of online video-based science communication. Thus, in this paper we conducted a mixed-method
    study to investigate the video uploaders, video content, and strategic narrations with viewer’s engagements
    of popular science videos shared on Bilibili, which is known for its collaborative commentary mechanism
    for videos called “Danmaku”. We first created a taxonomy of uploaders of popular science videos on Bilibili.
    Then we revealed the popular topics and coded a set of sampled videos by 9 content-related features to show
    the landscape. Finally, we illustrated the correlations between entertaining narration strategies and viewers’
    engagements via qualitative observations and the Danmaku data. This paper extends the scope of online
    video-based science communication research to Bilibili, and involves the Danmaku mechanism to the contexts.
    Our findings enrich the understanding of the viewers’ engagements with narration strategies of popular
    science communicators.
